Creating a DLL using MinGW

To compile a libsmdev DLL using mingw you'll need:
* mingw

To build a DLL using mingw use:
mingw32-configure --enable-winapi=yes
mingw32-make

It is recommended that you use WINAPI support but it is possible to compile
libsmdev without it (--enable-winapi=no)

If mingw32-configure and mingw32-make are not available you'll need to build
it by hand. For this you can use a script similar to the following:

#!/bin/sh
CC=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc
CXX=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-g++
AR=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ar
OBJDUMP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-objdump
RANLIB=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ranlib
STRIP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-strip
MINGWFLAGS="-mwin32 -mconsole -march=i586 "
CFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"
CXXFLAGS="$MINGWFLAGS"

CC=$CC CXX=$CXX AR=$AR OBJDUMP=$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$RANLIB STRIP=$STRIP ./configure --target=i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586 --enable-winapi=yes
CC=$CC CXX=$CXX AR=$AR OBJDUMP=$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$RANLIB STRIP=$STRIP CFLAGS="$CFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS" make

You should end up with the following DLL:
libsmdev-<version>/libsmdev/.libs/libsmdev-1.dll
